This is my take on one of Kaggles most popular data science competition; the Titanic Challange (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)


In this challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. 
In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

I use Python and Jupyter Notebook for my solution. My final score is ~0.8, which ranks around top 15 percent.
