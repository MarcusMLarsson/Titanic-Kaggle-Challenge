This is my take on one of Kaggles most popular data science competition; the Titanic Challange. 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

In this challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic accident. 
In particular, we are asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

For my solution, I use Jupyter Notebook with Python. My final score is ~0.8, which ranks in the top 15 percentile. 
80% accuracy is consistently achievable from a generalized model but I suspect anything over 85% is luck and/or overfitting the test set. People
scoring 90% and above are with most certainty cheating by looking up the data online.
