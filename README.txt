This is my take on one of Kaggles most popular data science competition; the Titanic Challange. 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

In this challenge, we are asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive the Titanic accident. 
In particular, we are asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

For my solution I use Python & Jupyter Notebook. My final score is ~0.8, which ranks around top 15 percent.
